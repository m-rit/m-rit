### [About me](https://github.com/m-rit)

I'm a software developer interested in identity solutions, distributed systems, and cryptography. Currently pursuing my master's in Computer Science at Texas A&M University, where I'm expanding my knowledge in cryptography and blockchain-related paradigms. Previously, I worked at Cisco for 3 years, developing and maintaining the Authentication and IAM infrastructure for a SaaS platform.

I'm always exploring projects in these fields, where I can happily get lost in their codebase. When I am not doing this, I enjoy reading about space.
